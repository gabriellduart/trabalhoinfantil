        <h3>The workload is another alarming factor: nearly 40% of children and adolescents in child labor work up to 14 hours per week. However, 20.6% of them have workloads of 40 hours or more, directly impacting their education and development. Among the youngest, aged 5 to 13 years, more than 80% work up to 14 hours per week. In the group aged 16 to 17 years, 31.1% work 40 hours or more.</h3>
