        <h3>According to IBGE, in 2023, the southern region of Brazil had 193 thousand people in child labor: 
        <br><br>
           - The drop in child labor was attributed to public policies, greater awareness and supervision in urban and rural areas. However, challenges persist, especially in agriculture and domestic work, where minors still face exploitation.<br>
           - In 2024, the South of Brazil had the lowest rate of child labor in the country, with 193 thousand children and adolescents in this condition, representing 3.8% of the age group from 5 to 17 years old. There was a significant reduction compared to 2022, following the national trend of a 14.6% drop in child labor. <br>
           - Child labor in southern Brazil varies between states. In Santa Catarina and Paran√°, efforts in rural areas have resulted in significant reductions, especially in agricultural areas, where child labor is historically more prevalent. <br>
           - In southern Brazil, child labor is more prevalent in the agricultural sector, especially on family properties, where children and adolescents help with harvests or related activities. <br>
