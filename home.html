<h1 class="oqe">What is Child Labor</h1>
<div class="texto1">Child labor in Brazil is a problem that violates the rights of children and adolescents,
    harming their development and access to education. Although the Constitution and the ECA prohibit work before
    the
    age of 16, many children are still exploited in hazardous activities. This affects their health and limits their
    future opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty.
    <br>
    <br>
    Minimum age: In Brazil, work is only allowed from the age of 16, except for activities such as
    apprenticeship from the age of 14 (following specific rules).
    <br>
    <br>
    Dangerous, unhealthy, or night work: Only allowed from the age of 18.
</div>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="ex1">Examples of Child Labor</h1>
<div class="texto2">Rural work: Harvesting fruits, sugarcane, coffee, among others.
    <br>
    Domestic work: Caring for children, cleaning, cooking in third-party homes.
    <br>
    Informal urban work: Selling products on the streets, working as a parking attendant, or carrying goods.
    <br>
    Child sexual exploitation: One of the most severe forms of child labor.
    <br>
    Work in factories or illegal workshops: Subjecting children to dangerous conditions.
</div>

<h1 class="dd">Research Data</h1>


<div class="texto3">-1.3 million children are in
    a state of child labor.
    <br><br>
    -The majority are boys aged between 14
    and 17 years old.
    <br><br>
    -The main causes are poverty,
    culture, and misinformation.
    <br><br>
    -The biggest impacts are on health,
    lack of education, and development.
</div>

<h1 class="cc">How to Combat</h1>
<div class="texto4">Strengthening public policies:
    <br>
    Creation and implementation of government programs to prevent and eradicate child labor.
    <br>
    Quality education:
    <br>
    Ensure access to well-structured schools, with trained teachers and curricula that stimulate
    child development.
    <br>
    Support for families:
    <br>
    Provide social assistance, income generation programs, and access to basic services to reduce
    economic vulnerability.
    <br>
    Awareness campaigns:
    <br>
    Inform and sensitize society about the impacts of child labor and the importance of protecting
    children's rights.

    <div class="texto5">Child labor in Brazil decreased
        <br>in 2023, compared to 2022, and
        <br>reached the lowest level in the historical
        <br> series.
        <br><br>


        Despite a significant increase
        <br> from 2016 to 2022, the rate dropped
        <br> again, being 4.9% in 2022 and 4.2% in
        <br> 2023 (age group). The decline was
        <br> attributed to economic improvement and
        <br> the increase of Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
        <br><br>



        Children working as
        <br> slaves often do not know
        <br> they are in this situation, being
        <br> related to not studying and not
        <br> having access to the internet to
        <br> know they are not included in
        <br> Human Rights.
        <br><br>



        The Northeast and Southeast
        <br> regions record the highest
        <br> rates of occupation, respectively 33% and
        <br> 28.8% of the 1.6 million boys and
        <br> girls working.
